Mychem Installation
-------------------

== Requirements ==
CMake v2.4.5 or higher
MySQL-dev v4.0 or higher
OpenBabel-dev v2.3.0 or higher

Note: Mychem should work with MySQL v4.0, but has not been tested.


== Quick Install ==
This section describes a simple way to compile and install Mychem.

=== Source Extraction ===
If you are using a command line interface, follow this instructions:
- For the tar gzipped archive:
# tar -xfzv mychem-0.9.3.tar.gz
- For the zip archive:
# unzip mychem-0.9.3.zip

=== Compilation and Installation ===
CMake can build the libraries and executables into any directory. If the
directory contains the source, the build is called in source. In other cases,
it’s called out of source. CMake strongly recommends and promotes building
out of source.
- In source build:
# cd mychem
# cmake .
# make
# make install

- Build out-of-source (recommended):
# cd mychem
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ..
# make
# make install
# cd ..

Note: You may need some root privileges to run make install.
Once the libraries are installed, you have to create the SQL functions.

For Unix like systems (Linux, BSD, Mac OS X), use the following command:
# mysql -u user -p < src/mysqldb.sql

For Microsoft Windows, use the following command:
# mysql -u user -p < src/mysqldb_win32.sql

== Custom Install ==

=== Setting the installation path ===
You can customize the installation prefix by using the following command:
# cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/convenient/path

=== Other tunning ===
Many build and installation parameters can be customized. Look at the CMake
documentation for further informations.
